# 5-DOF Articulated Robotic Arm (TinkerCAD Design)

![Robotic Arm Preview](./your-image-file.png)

## 🛠️ Project Description

This is a **beginner-level design** of a 5-DOF (Degrees of Freedom) articulated robotic arm created using **TinkerCAD**.  
It represents my **first attempt** at modeling a robotic arm in 3D, and was built as part of my learning journey in robotics and CAD (Computer-Aided Design).

---

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Fully articulated structure with **5 joints** (DOF)
- 🟠 Designed for modularity and ease of visualization
- 🧱 Constructed using basic geometric shapes for clarity
- 🎓 Educational purpose – demonstrates the basic concept of robotic arm movement

---

## 🔩 Degrees of Freedom Explained

This robotic arm has **5 Degrees of Freedom**, which include:

1. **Base Rotation** – Rotation around the vertical axis  
2. **Shoulder Joint** – Up and down arm movement  
3. **Elbow Joint** – Extension and contraction  
4. **Wrist Pitch** – Up and down wrist movement  
5. **Gripper Open/Close** – End-effector capable of basic object gripping

## 📌 Notes

- Built in **TinkerCAD** using standard shapes and groupings.
- This is a **conceptual prototype**, not currently motorized.
- Perfect for early prototyping, simulation, or education.

## 🧠 What's Next?

In the future, this model could be extended to:

- Add servo motors or simulate motion
- Export to STL and 3D-print
- Add control logic via Arduino or microcontrollers

## 💬 Author's Note

This is my **very first attempt** at designing a robotic system.  
Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
